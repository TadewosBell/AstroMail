# AstroMail

## Description
This is an email viewing client using GO lang Wails framework. The objective is to create a good looking email client that neatly desplays emails and can be used to send emails. 

## There are two motivations for creating this project:

### First:
    To test and develop the AstroCommit documentation tool. This is the first project that will be linked to it and will be used to develop that Astro protocol for generating repository docs. 

### Second:
    The objective intially is to use this to display email saved in AWS S3 and to send emails using AWS SES but the ultimate goal is to make it egnostic.
